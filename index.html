        • Born in 1914 at Cresco, Iowa, he lived with his family on their farm until the age of 19 when he left for the University of Minnesota thanks to the “National Youth Administration” during the Depression era.<br>
        • Unable to continue schooling due to financial issues, he took a job at Civilian Conservation Corps where he helped starving Americans. During which he would come to see how the need for food can change a man. <br>
        • In 1937, he finishes university and takes a job in the US Forestry Service. The would then marry Margret Gibson the following year. He is laid off as a result of budget cuts and heads back to school after being inspired by Elvin Charles Stakman. He studies under Stackman, who teaches him about breeding pest-resistant plants. <br>
        • He is asked by the military to work on waterproof glue, DDT to control malaria, disinfectants, and other applied science after his enroll in the military after the Pearl Harbor attack, is rejected. <br>
        • Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant Pathology. <br>
        • Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont in 1944, leaves behind his pregnant wife, and flies to Mexico to head a new plant pathology program. Over the next 16 years, his team breeds 6,000 different strains of disease resistant wheat - including different varieties for each major climate on Earth. <br>
        • Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each season and doubling wheat yields the following year. <br>
        • Visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding strains of wheat to the Indian subcontinent in time to help mitigate mass starvation due to a rapidly expanding population of which he receives a Noble Peace Prize in 1970. <br>
        • Becomes a distinguished professor at Texas A&M University in 1984. <br>
        • He suggests the approval and use of genetically modified crops, saying “we will have to double the world food supply by 2050” during 2005. <br>
        • Dies at the age of 95 in 2009. <br>

        Borlaug's work saved the Indian sub-continent from mass starvation. In his 90 years on this planet its human population has grown from about one billion to more than six billion. Without the hybrid wheats it was Borlaug's life's mission to develop and promote among the world's poorest farmers, few believe that this population could have been sustained.<br>
